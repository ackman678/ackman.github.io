### About

I'm a' µ neuroscientist working on the mechanisms by which the brain wires itself together. A better understanding of functional brain development is crucial for the prevention or treatment of many, if not all, neurological diseases, as well as realizing self-organization in the complex robotic systems of the future.

My time is spent generating, exploring, and visualizing lots of data regarding the functional dynamics among synaptic connections in the nervous system. To help accomplish this, I practice data wrangling by writing code in R and Matlab, with healthy doses of Python and unix shell scripts whenever I can.
