<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>I’m a’ µ neuroscientist working on the mechanisms by which the brain wires itself together. A better understanding of functional brain development is crucial for the prevention or treatment of many, if not all, neurological diseases, as well as realizing self-organization in the complex robotic systems of the future.</p>

<p>My time is spent generating, exploring, and visualizing lots of data regarding the functional dynamics among synaptic connections in the nervous system. To help accomplish this, I practice data wrangling by writing code in R and Matlab, with healthy doses of Python and unix shell scripts whenever I can.</p>
