A better understanding of functional brain development is crucial for the prevention or treatment of many, if not all, neurological diseases, as well as realizing self-organization in complex robotic systems of the future.\r\n\r\nI spend lots of time generating, exploring, and visualizing loads of data regarding the functional dynamics of electrical connections in the nervous system. To help accomplish this, I write lots of code in R and Matlab, with healthy doses of Python and the bash shell whenever I can.\r\n\r\n### Science\r\n\r\n[Google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qtmtHEUAAAAJ&hl=en)\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\n[Github repositories](https://github.com/ackman678?tab=repositories)\r\n\r\n[Gist scripts](https://gist.github.com/ackman678)\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n[Pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(ackman+jb%5BAuthor%5D+OR+ackman+j%5BAuthor%5D)+AND+(yale%5BAffiliation%5D+OR+marseille%5BAffiliation%5D+OR+ferrara%5BAffiliation%5D+OR+connecticut%5BAffiliation%5D))\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\n@ackman678  \r\n\r\nhttp://crair.medicine.yale.edu/people.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
